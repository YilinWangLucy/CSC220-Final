Python’s success revolves around several advantages it provides for beginners and experts alike:
Python is easy to learn. The number of features in the language itself is modest, requiring relatively little investment of time or effort to produce one’s first programs. 
Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. 
This simplicity makes Python an ideal teaching language, and allows newcomers to pick it up quickly. 
Developers spend more time thinking about the problem they’re trying to solve, and less time thinking about language complexities or deciphering code left by others.
