Python is used for web services and RESTful APIs. 
Python’s native libraries and third-party web frameworks provide fast and convenient ways to create everything from simple REST APIs in a few lines of code, to full-blown, data-driven sites. 
Python’s latest versions have powerful support for asynchronous operations, allowing sites to handle up to tens of thousands of requests per second with the right libraries.
