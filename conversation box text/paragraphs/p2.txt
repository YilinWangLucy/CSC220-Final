Python is broadly used and supported. 
Python is both popular and widely used, as the high rankings in surveys like the Tiobe Index and the large number of GitHub projects using Python attest. 
Python runs on every major operating system and platform, and most minor ones too. 
Many major libraries and API-powered services have Python bindings or wrappers, allowing Python to interface freely with those services or make direct use of those libraries.
